# Spell Cascade - itch.io Launch Reference Card

**Print this or keep in a tab while setting up your itch.io page.**

---

## THE ONE RULE
Publish page + upload files **AT THE SAME TIME** (not separately).

---

## TAGS (Choose 7-10)

| Priority | Tag | Why |
|----------|-----|-----|
| MUST | roguelike | Core genre, essential search term |
| MUST | survival | Core mechanic |
| MUST | deckbuilding | Unique differentiator |
| HIGH | fast-paced | Emphasizes 10-min runs |
| HIGH | action | Player expectation (combat) |
| HIGH | browser | Signals playable online |
| GOOD | horde-survival | If waves of enemies |
| GOOD | magic | Thematic (spells) |
| GOOD | permadeath | If runs end permanently |
| OPTIONAL | [one more if needed] | — |

**Golden Rule**: Only add tags that are TRUE. Wrong tags = wrong players = poor reviews.

---

## GENRE

**Pick ONE:**
- [ ] `Action` (broader reach: ~13,000 median views)
- [ ] `Roguelike` (smaller, highly-targeted audience)

**Recommendation**: `Action` (cast wider net, tags filter for precision)

---

## PRICING

- **Kind**: Name Your Own Price
- **Minimum**: $0.00
- **Default/Suggested**: $1.00

**Why PWYW?**
- No paywall = 37% engagement (vs 6% download-only)
- $1 default captures ~10-20% without friction
- Free barrier = word-of-mouth spread

---

## DESCRIPTION

### SHORT (2 sentences - shows in browse)
Example:
> Survive 10 minutes against endless enemies using an ever-growing deck of spells. Build synergies, upgrade your arsenal, and adapt to the chaos in this fast-paced roguelike deckbuilder.

### FULL (Multi-paragraph with ## headers)
- What is it? (2-3 sentences)
- Features (bullet list)
- How to Play (controls, goal, mechanics)
- Credits (links)

---

## SCREENSHOTS

**You need 4:**

| # | What | Why | Focus |
|----|------|-----|-------|
| 1 | Mid-run gameplay | Show core loop | Enemies, spells, UI, player |
| 2 | Deckbuilding menu | Highlight unique mechanic | Decision-making moment |
| 3 | Late game / chaos | Show progression | Many enemies or effects |
| 4 | Bonus (end screen / polish) | Show completion | Reward or visual highlight |

**Specs**: 1280px width, 16:9 or similar aspect ratio

---

## BROWSER BUILD (CRITICAL)

When uploading HTML5 ZIP:
- [ ] Check: "This file will be played in the browser"
- [ ] index.html in ZIP root (NOT in subfolder)
- [ ] ZIP: < 1,000 files, < 500MB total, no file > 200MB
- [ ] Tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari

**Impact**: 37% engagement rate if done right. 6% if download-only.

---

## WINDOWS BUILD (Optional but Recommended)

When uploading Windows ZIP:
- [ ] Platform: Windows (auto-select)
- [ ] DON'T check "browser playable"
- [ ] Include executable, DLLs, data folder, README
- [ ] Size < 200MB preferred

---

## RELEASE STATUS

- Set to: **Released**
- Why: Signals v0.2 is feature-complete and stable
- Note: Changing status later doesn't boost visibility (use devlogs instead)

---

## COVER IMAGE

**Specs**: 630 x 500 pixels (or 315 x 250)
**Already uploaded?** ✅ Just verify it looks good in thumbnail

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ Publishing page early, uploading files later (wastes visibility boost)
❌ Adding irrelevant tags (wrong audience, poor conversion)
❌ No browser build (37% engagement lost)
❌ Wall-of-text description (boring, no structure)
❌ Fewer than 4 screenshots (not enough visual information)
❌ Ignoring first-week comments (bad community signal)
❌ Spacing devlogs weeks apart (algorithm thinks game is dead)
❌ Setting to "In Development" for a v0.2 game (unnecessary doubt)

---

## SUCCESS METRICS (Week 1)

**Good signs**:
- 50+ views in first 24 hours
- 10+ comments (means engaged audience)
- Positive feedback (or constructive criticism)
- 5+ downloads/plays

**Normal**: Takes 2-3 days to build momentum

**If slow**: Check tags (accurate?), description (compelling?), screenshots (good variety?)

## FINAL THOUGHT

itch.io rewards:
1. **Accuracy** (right tags, right description)
2. **Visuals** (good cover, good screenshots)
3. **Engagement** (respond to comments, post updates)

Do these three well, and visibility follows. No secret sauce, just fundamentals.

Good luck! 🎮
