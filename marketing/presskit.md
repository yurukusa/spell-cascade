## One-Line Description

A 10-minute roguelike sprint where you chain skills, link supports, and discover devastating synergies as enemies swarm from all sides.

## Short Description (100 words)

Spell Cascade is a fast-paced roguelike where every run is a 10-minute sprint for survival. Move your tower with WASD, aim with your mouse, and choose from 5 Skills × 7 Supports to create devastating combos. Discover 3 hidden synergies that change the entire game. Earn Behavior Chips that automate your play as you prove your skill. Survive long enough and face a 3-phase boss. Built in Godot 4.3 by a non-engineer paired with Claude Code AI — proving that the barrier to game development is lower than ever.

## The Story

Spell Cascade was built entirely by a non-engineer (yurukusa) paired with Claude Code AI. No prior game development experience, no art team, no budget. The game is proof that AI-assisted development can produce real, playable games — not just prototypes.

The developer also created Azure Flame Dungeon (15,000+ lines of code, also AI-assisted), and writes about the process on Qiita, Zenn, Dev.to, and note.
