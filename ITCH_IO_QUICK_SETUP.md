## Troubleshooting

### "My game won't play in browser"
- Check: Is `index.html` in ZIP root (not in subfolder)?
- Check: Did you check "This file will be played in the browser"?
- Test: Can you unzip locally and open `index.html` in Chrome?

### "My description looks weird"
- Use `##` for section headers (they auto-format)
- Use `-` for bullet lists
- Leave blank lines between sections
- Test preview before saving

### "My tags aren't showing"
- They show once you save and reload page
- Max 10 tags
- Use autocompleter to stay within itch.io's curated tags

### "I can't change release status"
- Click "Edit" (top right, not "Edit page")
- Scroll down to "Release status" field
- Select from dropdown

## Final Reminder

The most important part: **Publish page + files simultaneously, at a chosen time (Tue-Thu, 11 AM or 3 PM).**

This gives you one visibility boost in the "Recent" section. Don't waste it by publishing the page early and uploading files later.

Good luck! 🎮
