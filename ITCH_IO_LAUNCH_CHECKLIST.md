## 1. TAGS (Maximum 10)

### Recommended Tags for Spell Cascade
Based on similar roguelike survival games on itch.io, use these tags:

**TIER 1 (ESSENTIAL - High Search Volume)**
- [ ] `roguelike` — Core genre indicator. Essential for discovery.
- [ ] `survival` — Core gameplay loop.
- [ ] `deckbuilding` — Unique mechanic that differentiates from other survivors.

**TIER 2 (HIGH IMPACT - Specific to Game)**
- [ ] `fast-paced` — Emphasizes the 10-minute run time.
- [ ] `horde-survival` — If applicable (wave-based enemy spawning).
- [ ] `action` — Movement + combat focus.

**TIER 3 (OPTIONAL - Build/Audience)**
- [ ] `pixel-art` — If visuals match (confirm from game).
- [ ] `browser` — Explicit signal for HTML5 playability.
- [ ] `magic` — Theme tag (deckbuilding with spells).
- [ ] `permadeath` — If runs end permanently (affects replayability).

### Tag Selection Rules
- ✅ Use accurate tags only. Irrelevant tags attract wrong audience → disappointed players → bad conversion.
- ✅ Avoid overcrowded tags (10,000+ games) unless your game stands out.
- ✅ Use the itch.io tag autocompleter when adding tags to stay within predefined, high-value tags.
- ✅ Research competitor tags: Visit https://itch.io/games/tag-roguelike/tag-survival to see what successful games use.

**Action**: Review Spell Cascade's actual mechanics and visual style. Cross-reference with top 10 games in the roguelike+survival+deckbuilding space to ensure tags are accurate.

## 2. DESCRIPTION

### Short Description (2 sentences max)
Currently missing or needs optimization. Should be punchy and hook players immediately.

**Template**:
```
[One sentence: Core hook - what makes this game special]
[One sentence: What players will experience]
```

**Example** (customize for your game):
> Survive 10 minutes against endless enemies using an ever-growing deck of spells. Build synergies, upgrade your arsenal, and adapt to the chaos in this fast-paced roguelike deckbuilder.

### Full Description Structure (Use Headers)
Break into sections using `##` headers (they'll display like site-generated sections):

```
## What's Spell Cascade?
[2-3 sentences explaining core concept]

## Features
- Deckbuilding mechanics for spell synergy
- 10-minute tense survival runs
- [Add others based on game]

## How to Play
- Basic controls (WASD / Mouse / etc.)
- How deckbuilding works
- Victory/defeat conditions

## Credits
[Link to CREDITS.md]

## More
- [Links to related projects, dev blog, etc.]
```

### Description Best Practices
- ✅ **Lead with visuals**: GIFs and screenshots do 80% of the work. Description fills gaps.
- ✅ **Answer "What will I do?" immediately**: Not "A game about..." but "Survive 10 minutes while..."
- ✅ **Highlight unique mechanics first**: "Unlike other survivors, Spell Cascade adds deckbuilding..."
- ✅ **Include controls**: Reduce friction for first-time players.
- ✅ **Break into scannable sections**: Wall of text = bounce.

---

## 3. SCREENSHOTS

### Current State
- ✅ 1 gameplay GIF uploaded
- ❌ Need 3-5 screenshots (recommended: 4)

### Best Practice: 4-5 Screenshot Variety
1. **Screenshot 1: Gameplay Overview**
   - Mid-run state with enemies, spells in action, UI visible
   - Shows core loop in one frame

2. **Screenshot 2: Deckbuilding Interface**
   - Player mid-decision: adding spell to deck, spell selection screen
   - Emphasizes the unique deckbuilding mechanic

3. **Screenshot 3: Early Game vs Late Game**
   - Contrast: early run simplicity vs late-game chaos
   - Shows progression/scaling

4. **Screenshot 4: Death/Victory/UI Polish**
   - End-of-run screen, stat breakdown, or visual polish moment
   - OR player feedback moment (e.g., combo trigger, spell synergy)

5. **Optional Screenshot 5**: Splash art, title screen, or best visual moment

### Screenshot Rules
- ✅ **Vary composition**: Not all the same scene/angle.
- ✅ **Show UI**: Players want to know what they'll see.
- ✅ **Use GIFs sparingly**: Animated GIFs as screenshots work but static frames are more scannable.
- ✅ **Aspect ratio**: itch.io accepts 16:9, 4:3, 1:1. Consistency matters.
- ✅ **Quality**: 1280px width minimum recommended.

**Action**: Extract or capture 3 additional gameplay moments to add to the page.

---

## 4. COVER IMAGE

### Current State
- ✅ Already uploaded

### Best Practice Verification
- ✅ Aspect ratio: 315:250 or 630:500 pixels
- ✅ Clear, eye-catching (first thing people see in browse)
- ✅ Readable title or readable visuals from thumbnail
- ✅ Communicates genre instantly (roguelike vibes visible)

**Action**: Verify existing cover meets specs. If not, regenerate/replace.

---

## 5. RELEASE STATUS

### Current Option: "In Development" vs "Released"

**Finding**: Status field is just a filter. No discoverability penalty for "In Development," but no boost when transitioning to "Released."

### Recommendation for v0.2
- **Set to "Released"** — Game is playable and feature-complete.
- **Rationale**:
  - v0.2 implies stable enough for public play.
  - "In Development" signals incomplete/buggy, which may deter casual players.
  - If substantial updates planned, use devlogs (not status change) for visibility.

**Action**: Change status to "Released" if not already set.

---

## 6. GENRE SELECTION

### Current State
- Needs confirmation (likely "Action" or "Roguelike")

### Best Practice for Spell Cascade
**Primary Genre**: `Action` or `Roguelike` (pick one primary)

**Rationale**:
- Action games (70th percentile) get ~13,000 views + 37% click-through rate in browser
- Roguelike is smaller tag but highly targeted audience
- Genre is **mandatory for recommendation algorithms** to work

### Alternative Approach
- Check if itch.io allows multiple genres. If yes: Primary + secondary
- Primary: `Action` (broader reach)
- Secondary: `Roguelike` (specific audience)

**Action**: Confirm current genre selection and optimize if possible.

---

## 7. BROWSER PLAYABILITY

### Current State
- ✅ HTML5 build exists and is playable

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] When uploading the HTML5 ZIP, "This file will be played in the browser" is **checked**
- [ ] index.html is in the **root of the ZIP** (not in a subfolder)
- [ ] ZIP contains < 1,000 files
- [ ] All extracted files total < 500MB
- [ ] Single largest file < 200MB
- [ ] Tested in-browser playability before upload

**Discoverability Impact**: Browser-playable games see 37% play rates vs 6% for download-only. Critical for downloads.

**Action**: Confirm browser upload settings are correct on the itch.io page.

---

## 8. WINDOWS DOWNLOAD

### Current State
- Likely not yet uploaded (confirm)

### Best Practice
- [ ] Provide Windows build as secondary option
- [ ] File size optimized (smaller = higher download rate)
- [ ] Include README with controls/system requirements in the ZIP
- [ ] Test before upload on a clean machine (or confirm in QA)

**Rationale**: Some players prefer download (offline play, anti-virus scan, mod support). Don't force browser-only.

**Action**: Prepare Windows build ZIP and upload as secondary file.

---

## 9. DEVLOG (Launch)

### Timing & Content
- [ ] Write launch devlog **before or same day as publish**
- [ ] Post title: "Spell Cascade is out now!" or "[Game Name] - Official Release"

### Launch Devlog Content (3-5 paragraphs)
```
## Spell Cascade is Live!

[Paragraph 1: Thank you / brief story]
"After [X weeks/months] of development, Spell Cascade is finally here!
It started as [origin], and evolved into..."

[Paragraph 2: What is it?]
"Spell Cascade is a 10-minute roguelike survival game with deckbuilding mechanics.
You'll summon spells, combo them together, and survive increasingly chaotic waves of enemies."

[Paragraph 3: Key features]
- Deckbuilding-driven gameplay
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]

[Paragraph 4: How to play]
"Head to [LINK], or download the Windows build.
Controls: [WASD / Mouse / etc.]
Target playtime: ~10 minutes per run."

[Paragraph 5: Call-to-action & thanks]
"Please share your feedback in the comments!
Special thanks to [team/collaborators]."
```

### Devlog Rules
- ✅ Keep it under 500 words for quick read.
- ✅ Include direct link to game page.
- ✅ Include a screenshot or GIF (shows up in the devlog listing).
- ✅ Devlogs appear in followers' feeds and "Recent Devlogs" section.
- ❌ Don't post multiple devlogs in 1 week (spam risk). Max 1-2 per month during development.

**Action**: Draft and schedule devlog for publish day.

---

## 10. NAMING & PRICING

### Name Your Price Configuration
- [ ] Pricing model: **"Name your price"**
- [ ] Minimum price: **$0.00** (free with optional donation)
- [ ] Default/Suggested: **$1.00** (appears as suggestion to buyers)

### Why This Works for Spell Cascade
- **Reach**: No paywall → casual browsers will click "Play" or "Download"
- **Revenue**: Default suggestion ($1) captures ~10-20% of engaged players
- **Marketing**: Free-with-donation games spread via word-of-mouth more easily
- **Discoverability trade-off**: Slightly lower than "Free" in filters, but compensated by higher conversion

**Action**: Ensure pricing is set to Name Your Price with $1 default.

---

## 11. TIMING & LAUNCH STRATEGY

### When to Publish
**Avoid**: Weekends (too much competition, gets buried fast)
**Best**: Weekday (Tue-Thu) around **11 AM or 3 PM in US timezone**

**Rationale**:
- Weekday = fewer games launching = higher visibility in "Recent"
- 11 AM = people browsing before lunch
- 3 PM = people taking breaks

**Critical Rule**:
- ✅ **Publish page + upload file at the SAME time**
- ✅ Placement in "Recent" is based on page publish date, not file upload date
- ❌ Don't create page early and upload later (wastes the visibility boost)

### First Week Post-Launch Strategy
1. **Day 1-2**: Monitor comments, answer all questions, fix critical bugs immediately
2. **Day 3-5**: Post progress devlog if you made any updates or tweaks
3. **Week 2**: Share on social media (Twitter, Discord communities, etc.)

**Action**: Pick a specific day/time to publish. Ensure all assets are ready before that moment.

---

## 12. COMMUNITY & ENGAGEMENT

### Comments vs Discussion Board
**Recommendation for Spell Cascade**: **Enable Comments**

- [ ] Enable comments on project page (Settings → Community)
- [ ] **Do NOT enable discussion board initially** (adds management overhead)

### Comment Moderation
- ✅ Comments appear at bottom of game page
- ✅ Developers can delete spam / off-topic posts
- ✅ Comments DON'T affect discoverability (no voting/rating system)
- ❌ itch.io doesn't moderate comments; you must stay on top of them

### Engagement Best Practices
- [ ] Respond to **all** first-week comments (builds community trust)
- [ ] Use comments to gather feedback for future updates
- [ ] Pin helpful community comments (if feature available)

### Why Comments Matter
- Not for algorithm boost, but for **player retention and feedback**
- Engaged players become repeat visitors
- Feedback = ideas for updates = more devlogs = more visibility

**Action**: Enable comments. Plan to respond to first-week feedback daily.

---

## 13. METADATA & EXTRAS

### Optional but Helpful Fields
- [ ] **Game description language**: Set to English (if available)
- [ ] **Content rating**: PEGI-7 or lower (no violence concerns? Confirm)
- [ ] **Credits/Links**:
  - Link to source code (if open-source)
  - Link to dev blog / portfolio

## Notes for the Developer

1. **Browser > Download**: The HTML5 build is your primary asset. 37% of viewers will play browser games vs 6% for download-only. Make sure it's polished.

2. **One-time visibility boost**: The "Recent" placement is based on publish date. Don't create a page early and upload later. Do it all at once.

3. **Devlogs are free marketing**: Unlike status changes, devlogs get indexed and appear in follower feeds. Post them for every meaningful update.

4. **No magic bullet for tags**: Accurate tags = targeted audience. Inflated tags = wrong audience = poor conversion.

5. **Name Your Price works**: For indie games on itch.io, PWYW (pay-what-you-want) often outperforms paid pricing. Free barrier + donation option = more reach + some revenue.

6. **Engagement matters**: Even though comments don't boost discoverability directly, responding to players builds loyalty. They'll leave positive comments, recommend to friends, and come back for updates.
