# Spell Cascade v0.1.0 — Release Notes

**Release Date**: 2026-02-16

## What's New

- **Core gameplay loop**: 10-minute survival with escalating waves, level-up chip upgrades, and a 3-phase boss at 225s
- **Build system**: Attack/Move/Skill chips with chain, fork, pierce, and more — each run feels different
- **Title screen & settings**: Start/Settings/Quit menu, master volume slider, fullscreen toggle
- **Mouse aiming**: Tower faces cursor for precise targeting
- **Shrine event**: Trade-off decision at 150s (Overcharge / Greed / Discipline)
- **Procedural SFX**: All sound effects generated at runtime (no external audio files)

## Known Issues

- Placeholder visuals (geometric shapes + Kenney pixel sprites)
- No music (SFX only)
- Boss kill time averages ~60s (target was 90-180s)
- Web version: Quit button has no effect (browser limitation)
- `area_set_shape_disabled` warning on enemy death (Godot 4.3, cosmetic)
