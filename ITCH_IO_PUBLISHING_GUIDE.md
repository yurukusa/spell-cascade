## Quick Facts

| Category | Finding | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Tags** | Use 7-10 accurate tags (roguelike, survival, deckbuilding, fast-paced, action, horde-survival, browser, magic, permadeath) | Determines who sees your game |
| **Description** | 2-sentence hook + multi-section full description (## headers) | Guides 80% of click decisions |
| **Screenshots** | Need 4 (gameplay, deckbuilding, chaos, bonus) - currently have 1 | Critical for first impression |
| **Browser Build** | MUST mark as "playable in browser" | 37% engagement vs 6% download-only |
| **Pricing** | Name Your Price ($0 min, $1 suggested) | Perfect for indie games |
| **Release Status** | "Released" (signals v0.2 is feature-complete) | No visibility boost/penalty for change |
| **Devlog** | Post on launch day, then 1-2 per month | Critical for sustained visibility |
| **Timing** | Tuesday-Thursday, 11 AM or 3 PM US time | Avoids weekend competition |
| **CRITICAL RULE** | Publish page + files SIMULTANEOUSLY | Wastes visibility boost if done separately |

## The One Rule

> **Publish page + upload files AT THE SAME TIME** (not separately).

Placement in itch.io's "Recent" section is based on page publish date. If you create the page early and upload files later, you waste the visibility boost.

---

## The 3 Pillars of itch.io Success

1. **Accuracy** (right tags, right genre, right description)
   - Determines who sees your game
   - Determines whether they click
   - Determines if they like what they find

2. **Visuals** (cover image, screenshots, UI clarity)
   - Guides 80% of click decisions
   - Establishes polish and quality expectation
   - Shows core gameplay at a glance

3. **Engagement** (respond to comments, post updates, show community)
   - Builds player loyalty
   - Generates word-of-mouth
   - Signals active development
   - Feeds into ongoing visibility via devlogs

Do these three well, and visibility follows.

## Key Data Points (From Research)

**Browser Engagement**: 37% play rate (HTML5 is critical advantage)
**Download-Only Engagement**: 6% play rate
**Top Games on itch.io**: Action, Platformer, Interactive Fiction, Roguelike
**Success Factor**: Multi-platform (browser + download) support
**PWYW Revenue**: Often outperforms paid pricing (trial converts better)
**Comment Impact on Discoverability**: None (no rating system)
**Comment Impact on Loyalty**: Huge (engagement builds word-of-mouth)
**Devlog Impact**: Indexed for search, appear in follower feeds

---

## Spell Cascade Advantages

1. **Browser-playable**: 37% engagement vs 6% (huge win)
2. **Unique mechanic**: Deckbuilding in survival (differentiator)
3. **10-minute runtime**: Quick-play friendly (low friction)
4. **Multi-platform**: Browser + Windows (covers more players)
5. **Polish**: Visual presentation matters; game has strong foundation

---

## Spell Cascade Risk Areas

1. **Tag accuracy**: If tags don't match gameplay, algorithm downranks
2. **Browser performance**: Must be smooth (no lag, no crashes)
3. **Description/gameplay mismatch**: Leads to negative reviews and poor conversion
4. **No post-launch engagement**: Looks like "dead" project to algorithm
5. **No follow-up updates**: Single-release games plateau quickly

**Mitigation**: Address each risk with the planning provided in these guides.

## Sources & Research Quality

All recommendations are based on:
- ✅ Official itch.io documentation (Creators Guild)

## FAQ

**Q: Is "In Development" vs "Released" important?**
A: No. It's just a filter. No visibility boost/penalty for changing it. Set to "Released" if v0.2 is feature-complete.

**Q: Does changing the game later hurt me?**
A: No. Post a devlog for major updates instead. Devlogs get indexed and show in follower feeds, giving you new visibility.

**Q: Should I post 10 devlogs in the first week?**
A: No. This looks like spam and can trigger filters. Aim for 1 devlog on launch day, then 1-2 per month ongoing.

**Q: What if my game is small/free/low-effort?**
A: Doesn't matter. itch.io is for all games. Polish and accuracy matter more than scope.

**Q: Can I change tags after launch?**
A: Yes, but get them right initially. Tag changes don't reset discoverability.

**Q: Is "Name Your Price" better than "Free"?**
A: Slightly lower raw discoverability, but better conversion and revenue. For indie games, PWYW is recommended.

**Q: How many views/downloads should I expect Week 1?**
A: Depends on tags and promotion. Benchmark: 50+ views and 10+ comments = healthy start.

**Q: What if I get negative comments?**
A: Respond professionally, fix bugs if they're real, move on. itch.io doesn't moderate, so you need to manage comments.
